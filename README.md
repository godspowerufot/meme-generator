Meme Generator
This meme generator is a web application that allows users to generate random memes or create their own customized memes by adding their own text to existing meme templates.

Usage
To use the meme generator, simply go to the website and click on the "Random Meme" button to generate a random meme. Alternatively, you can select a template from the available options and add your own text to create a customized meme.

To create a customized meme, follow these steps:

Select a template from the available options.
Type your desired text in the text boxes provided.
Customize the font, size, and color of your text.
Save your meme or share it on social media.
Technologies Used
The meme generator was built using reactjs, CSS, . The meme templates are sourced from various websites, and the text customization is powered by the Canvas API.

Future Updates
In the future, we plan to add more templates and features to the meme generator, including the ability to upload your own images and create memes from scratch.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
